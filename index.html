    <p>St. Martin is generally known as “Narikel Zinzira” in Bengali, means 'Coconut Island' and this is the only coral reef island in Bangladesh. It is a small island in the north eastern part of the Bay of Bengal, created the southernmost part of our country. St. Martin's Dutch side is known for its festive nightlife, beaches, jewelry, drinks made with native rum-based guavaberry liquors, and casinos. The island's French side is known for its nude beaches, clothes, shopping (including outdoor markets), and French and Indian Caribbean cuisine.
